# Washington EV Adoption — Tableau Dashboard + Python EDA

**TL;DR**  
Exploratory analysis and dashboard of electric-vehicle (EV) registrations in **Washington State** (2010–2024).  
Includes: data cleaning, county-level distribution, market share by make, model-year trend, and a **stacked bar** that shows —for each top county— the **Top-10 cities as % of that county’s total (Top-10)**.

> This project is meant for **EDA & storytelling**. The dataset isn’t designed for robust prediction models; the value here lies in **visual insight** and clear communication.
